# OpenGL examples with PyOpenGL and Pygame
The OpenGL examples are based on book "Developing Graphics Frameworks with Python and OpenGL" by Lee Stemkoski and Michael Pascale published by CRC Press in 2021. 

The examples cover all the book chapters with code, from 2 through 6, with some code changes and demonstrate GLSL programming by PyOpenGL. Pygame is used for control, windowing, and image loading.

You find the examples in an examples' folder. Just read a class description in a script and run it. Since the object-oriented approach is used, auxiliary classes are logically separated in other folders (packages).

With Python 3.8+, you also need the following packages or later:
- numpy 1.22.4
- pygame 2.1.2
- PyOpenGL 3.1.6
- PyOpenGL-accelerate 3.1.6

The code was tested with the following configurations on the same machine:

- OS: Windows 11; Vendor: ATI Technologies Inc.; Renderer: AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics; OpenGL version supported: 4.6.14761 Compatibility Profile Context 21.30.44.03 30.0.13044.3001; GLSL version supported: 4.60

- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS; Vendor: AMD; Renderer: AMD RENOIR (DRM 3.41.0, 5.13.0-48-generic, LLVM 12.0.0); OpenGL version supported: 4.6 (Compatibility Profile) Mesa 21.2.6; GLSL version supported: 4.60
